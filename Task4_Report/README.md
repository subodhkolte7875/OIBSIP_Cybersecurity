# Task 4: Network Security Threats and Mitigation

## Objective
The objective of this task is to study common network security threats and understand their impact along with basic mitigation techniques.

## Introduction
Network security threats are malicious activities designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer networks. Understanding these threats is essential for protecting sensitive data and maintaining secure systems.

## Common Network Security Threats

### 1. Malware
Malware includes viruses, worms, ransomware, and spyware that can damage systems or steal sensitive information.

### 2. Phishing
Phishing attacks trick users into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or financial details by impersonating trusted entities.

### 3. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
DoS attacks overwhelm a network or server with excessive traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

### 4. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks
In MITM attacks, attackers intercept communication between two parties to steal or manipulate data.

### 5. Brute Force Attacks
These attacks involve repeatedly trying different password combinations to gain unauthorized access.

## Mitigation Techniques
- Use strong firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
- Regularly update and patch systems.
- Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.
- Educate users about phishing and social engineering attacks.
- Monitor network traffic for suspicious activities.

## Conclusion
Understanding network security threats and applying proper mitigation techniques helps organizations protect their systems and data from cyber attacks. This task highlights the importance of proactive network security practices.
